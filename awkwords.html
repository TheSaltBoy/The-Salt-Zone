					<h2>Brief</h2>
					<p>Awkwords is a newly founded company whose goal is the help young people struggling with social anxiety to improve their social skills. As they are a new startup, they have no brand presence and need to build their image from the bottom up. I was brought on to provide some guidance and brand guidelines. I'll give you a quick look at my process here!</p>

					<h2>Research</h2>
					<p>Before I start anything I create a design brief. These are just a few questions I ask the client to get a better sense of what they are looking for. This helps me as much as it helps them.</p>
					<h3>Background</h3>
					<p>Awkwords is a newly founded company with no strong brand presence or identity.</p>
					<h3>Objectives</h3>
					<p>To create a strong and recognizable brand with a unique voice and style.</p>
					<h3>Target Audience</h3>
					<p>Specifically, 18-25 year old adults who struggle with social situations or are generally anxious. Broadly, anyone who suffers with social anxiety.</p>
					<h3>Message</h3>
					<p>We understand how difficult meeting new people can be, and that talking to others is not always easy. We can give you the tools to get ahead.</p>
					<h3>Competition</h3>
					<p>There are some apps that provide a few of the tools we offer, but none that offer them in one package. There are few apps that offer the same level of service to the socially anxious. Some possible indirect competition might be Whisper and Anomo.</p>
					<h3>Distinguishing Characteristics</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>-We understand socializing is hard</li>
						<li>-We're personable and understanding</li>
						<li>-We offer a personalized experience</li>
					</ul>
					<h3>Tone and Keywords</h3>
					<p>Genuine, Understanding, Empathetic, Calm, Reliable</p>
					<p>I'm able to refer back to this brief throughout the design process to keep myself on track.</p>

					<h2>Sketching</h2>
					<p>Once I've gotten an understanding of the client's needs I start making some preliminary sketches. A majority of my time was spent working on the character design for the mascot, Egbert.</p>
					<p>I drew on my experience with character design for Egbert. He is made with mostly round shapes to convery friendliness. I made sure to give him an extra derpy expression to give him +2 to his Relatability stat.</p>

					<h2>Visual Design</h2>
					<p>This is where the fun begins. I moved to illustrator to start bringing Egbert and the other visual elements to life. I also got a little more particular with the colors. I chose a pastel cyan and yellow, both of which have a calming effect.</p>
					<p>Awkwords' visual design makes heavy use of the speech bubble and egg imagery, tying it all in with the "Break out of your shell" tagline.</p>
					<p>I chose a typefaces I thought would add to the charm of the brand. The wordmark of the brand actually uses a Google font aptly named "Permanent Marker". The secondary typeface is Frutiger Condensed.</p>

					<h2>Conclusion</h2>
					<p>In the end I created some promotional material and some basic brand guidelines for Awkwords. I believe Awkwords fills a niche. There aren't enough high-quality services or tools for those who struggle with social anxiety. Awkwords is a big step and something I think has a bright future.</p>
