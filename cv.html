			<h2>Education</h2>
			<p>Through my studies I have gained experience in many areas including <span>UI and UX design, Branding and Identity, and Web Design.</span></p>
			<p>I’ve been able to work on several personal projects relating to my degree, and several other side projects. I’ve gained an understanding of the creative process and how to work effectively with deadlines</p>
			
			<br>
			
			<h2>Skills & Abilities</h2>
			<h3>Teamwork</h3>
			<p>I’ve worked with small businesses designing logos and the occasional website. I’ve had the opportunity to work with a lot of different people and have learned how to effectively work in a team. Many times I would be working in a team with as few as three people.</p>
			
			<h3>Time Management</h3>
			<p>Throughout my time as a student and a freelance designer I’ve had to work on a deadline. This has helped me to learn how to budget time on a project, and to set realistic goals in planning.</p>
			
			<h3>Creativity</h3>
			<p>I’ve always been creative, drawing and writing stories since I was a child. I’ve only become more so since working and studying. I like to put a little of myself in everything I do, which I like to believe gives personality to all my work.</p>
			
			<h3>Technical Skills</h3>
			<p>I’m confident in using the Adobe Suite of products, specifically Photoshop, Illustrator, and Animate. I’m also confident in using <span>HTML, CSS, PHP, and JavaScript</span> to build websites.</p>
			
			<br>
			
			<h2>Experience</h2>
			<h3>FREELANCE DESIGNER, SELF EMPLOYED, 2014-2016</h3>
			<p>After graduating high-school I spent two years travelling Canada living off savings and doing design work. I worked for multiple small businesses and other self-employed workers. Most of these projects involved illustration, logo design, and some web design.</p>
			<p>This time was invaluable in developing a work ethic, without which I could not have continued travelling and working. It also gave me the skills to work with a wide range of people and has developed my ability to work with clients effectively.</p>
