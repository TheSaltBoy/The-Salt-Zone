					<p>When I started to get serious about my work as a desginer I decided I would need a cohesive brand identity. I wanted to create an identity that would be recognizable and could reflect who I am as a person.</p>

					<h2>Design Brief</h2>
					<p>My creative brief was pretty simple. My main goal was to create a unique visual identity that would inform my design choices for the years to come.</p>
					<h3>Background</h3>
					<p>I'm a young up and coming designer with talent and style but without much presence.</p>
					<h3>Objectives</h3>
					<p>To create an interesting and appealing visual identity.</p>
					<h3>Target Audience</h3>
					<p>In the short term I'm more interested in appealing to potential employers. I think my style would be more appealing to younger audiences, around 18-25 years old.</p>
					<h3>Message</h3>
					<p>I'm a talented young designer and artist. I'm relatable and down to earth.</p>
					<h3>Competition</h3>
					<p>I suppose other designers are my main competition. I need to stand out visually and with my personality. However no direct competitors come to mind.</p>
					<ul>
					<h3>Distinguishing Characteristics</h3>
						<li>-I can bring a fresh new perspective to your brand design</li>
						<li>-I'm easy to work with, and will always keep your needs in mind</li>
					</ul>
					<h3>Tone and Keywords</h3>
					<p>Genuine, Relatable, Cool, Stylish, Fresh</p>
					<p>With this brief in mind I'm able to move onto the next stages.</p>

					<h2>Sketching & Research</h2>
					<p>The main elements I focused on in the beginning were my monogram, wordmark, and logo. I went through a lot of different ideas and designs. I tried to pull ideas from my personal experiences and interests, from video games to world cultures.</p>
					<p>Old video games were a major influence on the design of my monogram and wordmark. I looked at a lot of type used in old games as inspiration.</p>
					<p>The research and sketching of my logo were mainly focused on old cartoons, specifically those of the 60's and older. I grew up watching old animated tv shows and movies, and thought the aesthetic would work well for a logo, as well as injecting some personality into the brand.</p>

					<h2>Visual Design</h2>
					<p>After working with several ideas on paper I moved on and began to refine them digitally. I still went through several iterations here. Some designs looked nice on paper but didn't make the cut after digitization.</p>
					<p>Here I started to also look more into color. I started off with a kind of large palette of colors, which I reduced over time to what I use now. I wanted to use bright and bold color to emphasize the young and fresh feeling of my brand.</p>
					<p>I also begin looking for a typeface to use. Through my studies and side projects I've fallen in love with a few different typefaces. In the end I decided to use Akzidenz. It's a classic typeface that still looks modern.</p>

					<h2>Obstacles</h2>
					<p>I'm still a relatively inexperienced designer, and this was my first major branding project. There are a lot of things I would go back and do differently. Luckily I can freely make changes to my brand design as I see fit, and I hope to see it evolve in the years to come.</p>
					<p>I would say the largest obstacle was creating a design that reflected myself without being too overbearing. In the beginning I wanted to add all the things and the visual identity ended up muddied and unfocused. I had to reign in my expectations and really focus on the core of my brand message. I think it turned out for the better in the end.</p>

					<h2>Conclusion</h2>
					<p>With a lot of time and patience I feel like I've created a brand identity that I can be proud of. I think it really does well to reflect my personality. The guidelines I've made have helped immensely in directing my brand, helping me to keep my brand identity focused on my core message.</p>
