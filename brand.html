			<p>When I started to get serious about my work as a designer I decided I would need a cohesive brand identity. I wanted to create an identity that would be recognizable and could reflect who I am as a person.</p>

					<h2>Design Brief</h2>
					<p>My creative brief was pretty simple. My main goal was to create a unique visual identity that would inform my design choices for the years to come.</p>
					<h3>Background</h3>
					<p>I'm a young up and coming designer with talent and style but without much presence.</p>
					<h3>Objectives</h3>
					<p>To create an interesting and appealing visual identity.</p>
					<h3>Target Audience</h3>
					<p>In the short term I'm more interested in appealing to potential employers. I think my style would be more appealing to younger audiences, around 18-25 years old.</p>
					<h3>Message</h3>
					<p>I'm a talented young designer and artist. I'm relatable and down to earth.</p>
					<h3>Competition</h3>
					<p>I suppose other designers are my main competition. I need to stand out visually and with my personality. However no direct competitors come to mind.</p>
					<ul>
					<h3>Distinguishing Characteristics</h3>
						<li>I can bring a fresh new perspective to your brand design</li>
						<li>I'm easy to work with, and will always keep your needs in mind</li>
					</ul>
					<h3>Tone and Keywords</h3>
					<p>Genuine, Relatable, Cool, Stylish, Fresh</p>
					<p>With this brief in mind I'm able to move onto the next stages.</p>

					<h2>Sketching & Research</h2>
					<p>The main elements I focused on in the beginning were my monogram, wordmark, and logo. I went through a lot of different ideas and designs. I tried to pull ideas from my personal experiences and interests, from video games to world cultures.</p>
					<p>Old video games were a major influence on the design of my monogram and wordmark. I looked at a lot of type used in old games as inspiration.</p>
					<p>The research and sketching of my logo were mainly focused on old cartoons, specifically those of the 60's and older. I grew up watching old animated tv shows and movies, and thought the aesthetic would work well for a logo, as well as injecting some personality into the brand.</p>

					<h2>Visual Design</h2>
					<p>After working with several ideas on paper I moved on and began to refine them digitally. I still went through several iterations here. Some designs looked nice on paper but didn't make the cut after digitization.</p>
					<p>Here I started to also look more into color. I started off with a kind of large palette of colors, which I reduced over time to what I use now. I wanted to use bright and bold color to emphasize the young and fresh feeling of my brand.</p>
					<p>I also begin looking for a typeface to use. Through my studies and side projects I've fallen in love with a few different typefaces. In the end I decided to use Akzidenz. It's a classic typeface that still looks modern.</p>

					<h2>Obstacles</h2>
					<p>I'm still a relatively inexperienced designer, and this was my first major branding project. There are a lot of things I would go back and do differently. Luckily I can freely make changes to my brand design as I see fit, and I hope to see it evolve in the years to come.</p>
					<p>I would say the largest obstacle was creating a design that reflected myself without being too overbearing. In the beginning I wanted to add all the things and the visual identity ended up muddied and unfocused. I had to reign in my expectations and really focus on the core of my brand message. I think it turned out for the better in the end.</p>
